## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA or another Kotlin-compatible IDE.
3. Make sure `kotlinx.serialization` is set up.
4. Create a file at `data/users.json` with this content:

```json
[
  {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin",
    "auth": "admin"
  }
]
```
5.	Run the app. Use admin as both username and password to log in.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
-	Users with the user role can log in, but only admins access the control panel.
-	All data is stored in a flat JSON file â€” no database required.
